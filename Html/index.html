        <h3>Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello! I am a passionate, newly graduated backend developer with a deep love for Java programming and creating innovative technology solutions. My enthusiasm for problem solving and creating efficient software has led me to gain experience in several key technologies, such as Spring Boot, SQL and MySQL.

            My main focus is on microservices architecture and building robust and scalable REST APIs. I worked on several personal projects that allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world situations and demonstrate my ability to learn quickly and face new challenges.
            
            What sets me apart is my determination to stay up to date with the latest technology trends and my willingness to constantly learn. I am eager to join a passionate team at a technology and software development company, where I can contribute my enthusiasm, technical skills and creativity to take innovative projects to the next level.
            
            If you are looking for someone with a solid foundation in backend development in Java and the ability to quickly adapt to new technologies, I am ready to be part of your team! I am excited about the opportunities the future has in store and am willing to face challenges with a spirit of continuous learning. Let's talk and find out how I can contribute to the success of your company!
